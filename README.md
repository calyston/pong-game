## How To Play
* Controls for Player 1: W to move the paddle up, S to move the paddle down.
* Controls for Player 2: Up Arrow to move the paddle up, Down Arrow to move the paddle down.
* Press spacebar to pause the game.

## Rules
* The first player to reach 5 points gets an increase in their paddle size. 
* If the same player reaches 10 points, they see another increase in their paddle size. 
* If one player reaches 10 points and then the other player reaches 5 points, the player who reached 5 points will still see an increase in paddle size.
* If the other player then reaches 10 points before the first player wins, both paddles return to original size.
* **First player to reach 15 points wins!**

## Technologies Used

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Yarn, Parcel, GIT, Bash.

## Personal Learnings

This project was my first time working with JavaScript and SVGs; I learnt how to use and manipulate JavaScript in order to perform basic animations for the game, such as the movement of the ball and paddles, and add extra functionality, those being accelerating the ball during rounds and giving the paddles smooth movement. For visuals, I decided to add a retro video game background using CSS and the music from the game using JavaScript to coincide with the retro theme of Pong.

## Installation Instructions

Ensure you have both [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and Yarn installed before starting.

**Install dependencies:**

`$ npm install`

**Run locally with the Parcel dev server:**

`$ npm start`

Download the project and navigate to the project directory.

Once you run the start command `$ yarn start` in your terminal you can access your project at http://localhost:3000.
